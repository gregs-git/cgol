Conway's Game of Life for Everything

A project using Conway's Game of Life (CGOL) as an arbitrary application to explore different data technologies.

ROADMAP

0.1 - working version of CGOL in place. Given a matrix of size x by y, script computes all possible starting states, and for each state, a full evolution of the rules until a repetitive state is reached. COMPLETE

0.2 - a better terminal display of the process

0.3 - add database for persistent storage of results

TODO

- Understand versioning in github
